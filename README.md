<h3>About</h3>
<p>
This will be a software which will be used to create Interactive HTML5 presentations.
I started this as practice, but it started to grow in size and my plans for the project started 
to grow, so <b>after losing a copy of the project</b> which set me back 2 weeks of development
I decided that I must make a repository.
</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
The goal is simple- to create an easy to use, simple and free, open source application which will create (and maybe host)
presentations and will  be opened for add ons.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
At this state of development  it's too early to write this.
</p>

<h3>What has been done so far</h3>
<p>
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
In the folder titled "Example" I've made a simple presentation wich features
some of the interactivity, such as the ability to resize and drag the elments.
