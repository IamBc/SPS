<h3>About</h3>
<p>
A small piece of software made for fun.
</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
To simply create a working prototype of a software that will generate (and maybe host) html based presentations.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
 This section will be filled at a later stage of development.
</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>
First of all you should start by ajusting the size of the window with your browser zoom. Once this is done you can press the right button on start adding
elements or to set the default font and size for the presentation. Once you have created an element, again by right clicking on them you open a new window
where you can edit the element. For example if you click on <b>insert</b> on a text field a menu with a simple text editor will open which you can use to
generate the needed text. The <b>minify </b> option will make the element small, where as the <b>bigify</b> option will restore the element's original size.
<b>Remove</b> removes the element.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
The current example is pretty outdated, but still works.
